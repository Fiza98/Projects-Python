A machine learning algorithm is used to find relationships between features and labels. Features are the independent variables that we feed into an algorithm to train a machine learning model, and labels are the dependent variables that we aim to predict using the machine learning algorithm.

Visualizing a machine learning algorithm means visualizing a trendline of the predicted values by the machine learning algorithm. What happens is that when we train a machine learning model using an algorithm, we feed the data into the algorithm, the algorithm finds the relationship between features and labels. Features are independent variables that we use to train the model, and labels are dependent variables that we aim to predict.

So when we visualize a machine learning algorithm, it shows the trendline of the values of the predicted labels according to the features.

first train a linear regression model to predict the sales of a product based on the amount spent on its TV advertising and, then I will visualize the predictions of the linear regression algorithm by using the plotly library in Python
